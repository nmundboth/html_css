  	<p><b>Previous WebCareer Client</b></p>
  	<p>I recently migrated to Canada and was applying for a web design job here.
  		However, I sent my resume numerous times to employers but I did not get any reply.
  		I registered with WebCareer and they helped me with my resume. Thanks to them, I was
  		able to get an entry-level position at XYZ Designing. I trust WebCareer!</p>

  	<p><b>Current WebCareer Client</b></p>
  	<p>I was previously a graphic designer and I wanted to change my career to web
  		 designing. I was looking for a crash course to acquire some basic skills and
  		 hopefully get an entry-level web designer position. I registered in WebCareer's
  		 basic level course and the course was very useful. I landed a job at PGR
  		 Enterprises and I love my job! I am currently taking advanced web designing
  		 courses at WebCareer.</p>
